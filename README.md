I did not make this game. 

I simply imported the archived Google Code source from [here] (https://code.google.com/p/castlevaniarl/) so I could learn from it. 

All credit, rights, and privileges go to the original author, Slash, who has made [a bunch of awesome games] (http://slashie.net).

Check his work out, I have actually played most of the games and they are quite nice and 
excellent examples of quality work. Good design, implementation, etc.
